<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Hlakaniphani Malinga a young and vibrant male in his middle 20,s. Iâ€™m confident about my high degree of aptitude 
  in the latest technologies. I am someone who is always willing to learn and embrace new things and I don't give up until  
  I achived my objective. 
</p>

<p>I have work on a number of projects during my studies.I am a very strong team worker and I understand that in oder
    to achieve difficult project and tasks you have to work with other people and you must bring in their skills 
    and their experiences. I am also very good at working under pressure and I actually prefer to be in situations
     where the pressure is on, because I believe this is where I am at my best </p>

<p>My biggest weakness is the facts that I focus too much on detail during projects or tasks.
   I am a detailed orientated person but when a project has a time limit this is not always helpful however
     I am trying to be more mind full in situatione like this and 
  I am learning to focus more on the end goal of the project task that I am responsible for</p>
